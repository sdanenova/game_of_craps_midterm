# game_of_craps_midterm
Welcome to test my vversion of Game of Craps using object-oriented programming in Python!
- To run this code please download "Craps_upd_final.ipynb" file to your current respirotary and run the code. All classes and methods are provided in one code. Necessary inheritance for the classes were implemented.
- Please disregard other files in this branch as they were used either as draft versions or looking for the ideas for various Craps game building
- The code mostly follows the instructions provided in the assignment guidance except for the following steps that are quite different:
  - Payout method was implemented within methods for Passline, DontPass, and Odds and provides updated information for win amount and current amount in the bankroll. Payout ratio was considerred for each bet type explicitly.
  - Methods for Passline, DontPass, and Odds also include the status of win/lose after each bet made
  - For testing purposes main function works for 10 rounds of the game

Hope you enjoy playing it!
